This websites has a bio about me, my job history, education hsitory and a list of my top ten favorite video games. Before entering seeing the webpage promtps the user for their name, asks 5 yes or no questions about me giving back feedback about if they were correct or not. Then the site randomly generates a number between 1 and 10 and asks the user to guess the number. Feed back is given if the user enters a number too low, too high, or a number not in the number range. The last question prompted is a multiple answer question about my favorite video game title. The score of how many question were answer correctly will display at the end.
